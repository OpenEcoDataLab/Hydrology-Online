# Hydrology Online

This project is funded by the NSF RAPID Hydrologic Sciences program (Award 2028778). It's meant to make teaching courses online easier and better (sensu [Sal Khan of Khan Academy)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/opinion/coronavirus-school-digital.html).
The team includes:

- Anna Bergstrom
- Tim Covino
- Karin Emanuelson
- Bryce Pulver
- Matt Ross
- [The much larger RAPID team](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2028737&HistoricalAwards=false)
- CUAHSI

This landing page is under construction. But we wanted to share our first
complete sets of lectures/homework/applications. Eventually we hope a bunch
of people will contribute to this page and [hydrolearn](https://www.hydrolearn.org/),
which helped inspire our approach. 

## Hydrograph separation

  - [Baseflow and Stormflow lecture and text](hydrology/1_baseflow_stormflow/0_hydrograph_separation_lecture.html)

  - [Rubric here](hydrology/1_baseflow_stormflow/Hydrolearn_OUtline_Baseflow.pdf)
  
  - Analysis assessment [here](https://cuahsi.shinyapps.io/1_baseflow_vs_stormflow/)
  
  - Interactive web app on mountaintop mining impacts to streamflow [here](https://cuahsi.shinyapps.io/mtm_baseflow/)
